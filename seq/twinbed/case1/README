problem appears to work only when mflowThreshod is 1e-3 why
but the single bed problem does not have this issue. Why???
(issue with common resevoirs ...having connect with several devices
  similar to three valve problem ...???)
Also, the threshold equaiton is not visible in c code? but some how
appears to effect the solution ?? how investigate furhter


A -   with regStep in B.C of adsorber
B -   with Max function (C0 continuity but no C1 continuity)


Well just forget every thing. Keep it simple. Just avoid regStep for 
adsorber Boundary conditions. Using if statements and using m_flow as
the variable for flow reversal ditermination. Earlier I was using 
pressure drop. 

1. Problem solved with mflowThreshold=1e-3, dpTol=1e3 (valve only)
        Now all of the flow stuff from adsorber end turned out to be

2  Without tweeking mflowThreshold Problem is solving but very slowly.


Developed 3Node joiner. To avoid internal stream mixing alberaic equations.
(P3Mixer.mo)


plots directory has comparison plots between Default mflowThreshold Level=1e-7
and other level of 1e-3. The first one took 11 hours to run to get 40sec. data.
The second one took 23 minutes for the same 40sec. simulaiton.
Closer examination of results showed very little difference. Except the media 
density in the closed (almost closed? numerically) jumps like a yo yo from inlet
to outlet ... since density switches with flow direction.

Perhaps it is not a bad idea to use "sqrt(Rhoin * Rhoout)" for the valve afterall.

=========================
v1.11.0-dev.135+g30c4b4c
=========================
     Moved to above version. Problem solved in 4.5 hours ... 40 sec.
How can I resolve this??  

Unable to restart 40sec solution. Fails to initialize why? inconsistent initializaiton ???
Tried to solve completely upto 360sec. Solution gaveup after 20 hours of computation
problem failed at 90sec simulation with integration failure due to non-lin eqn 2080.
Comparison of results with previous results showed good correspondence upto 40 sec.

Why are we having issues with convergence ??? And why such slow integration speed?

Restart issue relates to -iim switch. It should be set to default not none. And I need to
declare all counters as descrete variables. That is another line of investigation.

But for now, I am able to get converged solution in 40min for 40 sec simulaiton. I needed to 
use mflowThreshold like before for the problem to solve this fast. Tried a crazy value of 0.01
Results compard with 1e-3 threshold. And they are very similar.

Another curious thing happened at time 34 sec. Rho value gets stuck at negeative values for a while
but the solver eventually gets over it.

Maximum flow magnitude is of the order of 0.01 kg/sec. I guess 1e-5 or 1e-4 threshold should be the correct value
for flow reversal or zero flow implementations.

I am going to slow down the valve responses to 0.5sec.  And see the effect too.

Phew ... I figured that  by specifying nominal value  ... mixing node calculation uses
mflowMin = nominalValue * mflowThreshold. That now explains why I can't use default mflowThreshold of 1e-7.
and mflow_Threshold=1e-2 for nominalValue=5e-3 is good enough

Noted that med.d can get negative ... even with good values for composition. This happens when
med.d itself becomes an iteration variable. Replacing sqrt(med.d) in the valve eqn. with sqrt(abs(med.d))
allowed the integration to proceed without non-linear solver getting stuck.

Simulation succeeded for twin bed, with 0.5sec valve response, 1000Pa dpTol
Everything compared well with other simulations that did not proceed well due to non-convergence.
Tried rerunning with noRootFinding simulation stopped at 51.3sec. Again good correspondence to
previous run. But simulaiton is slower. Both had issues of convergence at certain times.
51.3, 61.3. Closer examination of data revealed %opening of Vout on both beds, is going to large negative
and decay to zero after 2secs.
