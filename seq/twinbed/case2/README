when two beds are connected to common sinks, sources 
the convergence is effected. Tweeks to make it work only
succeeded when I increased flowThreshold to 1e-3
Problem takes longer to solve

Tried completely independent twin beds. Strange as it may seem
problem does not intialize at all. Renaming ports did not work either.
just in case re-ordering makes any difference.

Tried common inlet src for both beds. Presto, problem solves now.
Also, I don't need to change flowThreshold at all.

Tried common atm only. Runs awfully slowly. Took 1 hour for 4sec integ.
