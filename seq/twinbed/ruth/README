 single bed sim running very slow
    
 experiments with duel bed with purge
 showed, the simulation speed is predominantly
dictated by the Axial Dispersion.

Changing the control volume size had very little effect
on speed.


    Currently running 10xDiff
    Finished 100xDiff .. in 15 minutes

time to go to bed.

    Finally getting somewherer. Rectified the error in mass flow rate
calculation due to use of improper superficial velocity. U instead of
U*Voidage  ..  
    Now I can get correspondence with Ruth's reference data page 187.
I needed to use Peclet number of 250 instead of 500 for the simulation to
run faster. Run2 directory has the results. Run1 had outlet valve setting to
get half the out flow rate specified in the book. I get poor recovery. Because
I am not drawing the product I make :)))
   I am now certain that the flows given in the book  are per bed. phew.
Run 2 has same purge valve setting as Run 1. Now it is also clear that the adsorption
pressure reported is the avg. pressure during feeding stage at pseudo steady state.
 
Run 2 took about 5.5hors to complete. 2000 sec simulation. 

Run 3 ran for 200 sec. with slower valves to see if it simulates any
faster or gives any diifferent results. No change observed between 
previous run and this one.

Run 4 is another run of 3 with much slower valve response 2wice more.
at 200 sec, this gives better product quality than earlier run, and consumesless air.

Moving to High  pressure runs
=========================================================
Lot of explorations :  
     Problem started to blow up with no reason since I removed sign check
in fluid density calculation in the valve equation. Wasted lots of runs with
low axial dispersion at high pressures thinking that something sinister was
happening with high pressure runs.
    In the wash, introduced individual Collocation Coeff. types to better
specify proper ranges to the coefficients. Weirdly, even when coef. values exceed
the speciified range we don't get warnings. Not very clear as to how warnings are
piped to the output. Are they being lost??

Now it is clear the valve equation should protect against negative
square roots. Solution path unstable if you don't have it.



Run5 >>> High pressure run at 4bar, 160sec cycle time
         Diffusivity set at 1.5e-4. Slow run but converges surely.
         Using much less air than reported value. Product quality is
         a bit lower. Recovery is far better than reported value.
  Linear depressurization and pressurization cycle .. valves tuned
to give.

Run 6 >>>  Tried doubling Axial dispersion .. it dropped recovery 
to 20% with avg. O2 to 67%. All flow rates are similar to Run5. The
run speeds up. but ...
